  is when Cecil was killed. If you don't know who Cecil is he was a black maned lion 
  who lived in Zimbawe, and was lured in and killed. Unfortunately Xanda had a
  similar fate not too long after.Each year, hundreds of thousands of wild animals
  around the world are killed in trophy hunts. Where the primary motivation is to obtain 
  animal parts (that is, their heads, hides or claws and even the whole stuffed animal)
  for display and for bragging rights, but not for subsistence. Cruel and unsportsmanlike
  practices like baiting, hounding and trapping, also captive hunts, in which hunters pursue animals who
  can not escape ensure that animals do not stand a chance and hunters bag an easy prize.
