    The humane society is an organization thet helps keep animals safe.
They help to end a lot of animal cruelty that is going on in the United States.
They stop things like animal fighting and puppy mills.
They are working to make laws that allow animal cruelty to be changed.
One of the laws that they are working on changing is cosmetics being tested on 
animals. They believe that the extreme confinement of animals on farms is bad. 
They need help to achieve all of their goals. You can help by making a donation.
